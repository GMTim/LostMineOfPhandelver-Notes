He'll bargain the life of [Sildar](../npcs/sildar-hallwinter.md) for the head of Klarg in [area 8](../locations/cragmaw-hideout.md#8-klargs-cave). If the party declines, then Cloak will drop [Sildar](../npcs/sildar-hallwinter.md) into [area 8](../locations/cragmaw-hideout.md#8-klargs-cave), dropping him to 0 hitpoint. Even if they do it, Cloak will then barging for treasure, going back on his word.
