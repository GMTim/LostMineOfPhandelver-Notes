# Goblin Trail
---

### Description
- The goblins have clearly spent a lot of time setting up the ambush. There is a clear trail that leads off [Triboar Trail](../locations/triboar-trail.md).
- A well padded and messy dirt trail leads away from the road.

### Instructions
 - The party can easily tie off the oxen and leave the cart on the road.
 - The path takes about 20 minutes to follow.
 - If characters are searching for traps as they go, they will automatically find the following traps.
 - 10 minutes down the trail the party runs into a snare trap (`PP 12` to notice). `DC 10 Dex` save if trap is triggered. Failed save, and player is [restrained](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#restrained_phb). Cutting snare will release player. If not lowered carefully player will take `d6 bludgeoning` damage.
 - 20 minutes down the trail the party runs into a pit trap (`PP 15` to notice). `DC 10 Dex` save if trap is triggered. Failed save player falls into pit and takes `d6 bludgeoning` damage.
 - Trail leads to [area 1](../locations/cragmaw-hideout.md#1-cave-mouth) of [Cragmaw Hideout](../locations/cragmaw-hideout.md)
