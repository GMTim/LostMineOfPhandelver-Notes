 - Old moss covered stone ruins are mixed in with new wooden buildings.
 - Muddy cart track snakes through town, ultimately leading to ruined manor house on a high hill.
 - Children are at play on the town green, and townsfolk are running errands.
 - If [Sildar](../npcs/sildar-hallwinter.md) is with the party he suggests the party heads to the [Stonehill Inn](#stonehill-inn).

  - Tells them about [Wave Echo Cave](../locations/wave-echo-cave.md) if [Sildar Hallwinter](../npcs/sildar-hallwinter.md) didn't. See [Goblin Den](../locations/cragmaw-hideout.md#6-goblin-den).
  - Tells party about [Nundro](../npcs/nundro-rockseeker.md) and Tharden Rockseeker, [Gundren's](../npcs/gundren-rockseeker.md) brothers. They are camping somewhere out of town, and haven't been seen in a tenday, so they are due any day for a resupply.

>### Edermath Orchard
**Description**
- Cottage next to apple orchard.

**DM Notes**
- Owned by [Daran Edermath](../npcs/daran-edermath.md), retired adventurer.

He knows they hang out in [The Sleeping Giant](#the-sleeping-giant), but that their [main headquarters](../locations/redbrand-hideout.md) is under [Tresendar Manor](#tresendar-manor).
- [Daran](../npcs/daran-edermath.md) asks the players if they'd be willing to go to the [Old Owl Well](../locations/old-owl-well.md) couple of days northeast. He's heard of miners being chased away from the area, and rumors of undead. There is an old Netheril tower there, and it might have old wrong magics.
