### History
The town was once destroyed by evil wizards, and orcs hundreds of years ago. In the last four years or so it has been rebuilt by settlers from cities in the Sword Coast.  
Phandalin has no government, but elects someone townmaster each year. Townmaster is judge in minor disputes, and record keeper of the town.

### Description
 - 40-50 simple log buildings.
 - Old moss covered stone ruins are mixed in with new wooden buildings.
 - Muddy cart track snakes through town, ultimately leading to ruined manor house on a high hill.
 - Children are at play on the town green, and townsfolk are running errands.
 - If [Sildar](../npcs/sildar-hallwinter.md) is with the party he suggests the party heads to the [Stonehill Inn](#stonehill-inn).

**GM Notes**
- If at anytime the players leave town for whatever reason, see [Overland](../locations/overland.md) location.

 ### **Event - Redbrands**
